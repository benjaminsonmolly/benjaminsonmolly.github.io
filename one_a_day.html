      <p class = "dark-mode">thanks Justin Odisho: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XJt9uXwMwM" class="inline-link-dark">original video</a></p>

      <h1 class = "dark-mode">|-> PART ONE <-| </h1>
      <p class = "dark-mode">time so far: 30 minutes</p>
      <p class = "dark-mode">Got the titles added- having trouble with the tools and adjusting sizes and getting everything centered. Here's the first animation and mask. Still very basic, but I get how it works. It’s so customizable.</p>

      <h1 class = "dark-mode">|-> PART TWO <-| </h1>
      <p class = "dark-mode">time so far: 35 minutes</p>
      <p class = "dark-mode">Getting quicker! Followed the same steps for the other side of the line. Feeling a little cocky.</p>

      <h1 class = "dark-mode">|-> PART THREE <-| </h1>
      <p class = "dark-mode">time so far: 45 minutes</p>
      <p class = "dark-mode">And done! Added the animation to the line and copied the keyframes (flipping them) to get the animation to end. Pretty happy with the final result- it’s simple, but I have to start somewhere. Sped up a little with a cute background and some little sound effect, and it could work! </p>

      <h1 class = "dark-mode">|-> PART ONE <-| </h1>
      <p class = "dark-mode">time so far: 10 minutes</p>
      <p class = "dark-mode">Already feel like I’m getting a bit more comfortable, even though that’s probably false confidence. Sticking with the same boring name (sorry) for now, but playing around with making my own animation preset. Also trying to learn some keyboard shortcuts cause I know those are essential to a good workflow.</p>

      <p class = "dark-mode">time so far: 15 minutes</p>
      <p class = "dark-mode">Added some character tracking to give the text movement- I even strayed away from the tutorial to add some easy ease stuff which I learned from the last video!</p>

      <p class = "dark-mode">time so far: 25 minutes</p>
      <p class = "dark-mode">And done! This was definitely a quicker tutorial but I think the effect is elegant and simple. It’s just helping to show me what’s possible and get comfortable with the tools, which I think is already working. Till next time! </p>
